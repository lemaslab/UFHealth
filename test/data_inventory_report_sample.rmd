## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. This is the decription of the report with some details. <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

#Data Inventory- Delivery
```
| Tables        | dat.redcap           | dat.dropbox  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| v1      | `r dat.redcap[[1]]` | 
| v2      | centered      |   
| V3      | are neat      |    


## Including Plots

You can also embed values from the data into text, for example: the values in dat.redcap are: `dat.redcap[[1]]`

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
